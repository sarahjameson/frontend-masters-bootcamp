# Code a Blog Page
I've given you some images and a picture of a web page layout. You have everything you need to lay this page out as a blog page. Can you figure out how to code this? To complete the layout, you will need:

* Think about borders, margin, and padding to make the page pretty.
* Think about horizontal nav bars for styling the top navigation. How about the bottom alien social media links?
* Consider floats for arranging images and text.
* Consider flexbox for making the header work correctly.
