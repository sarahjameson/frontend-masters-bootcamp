    <h3>Some important things to know about me</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>I don't want to decide if I prefer cats or dogs because I love both and feel bad deciding. Why is it such a divided topic?!</li>
        <li>My favourite kind of tea is chamomile tea. It always make me feel better if I'm having a stressful day. If you're a tea drinker in general, I think we'll get on wonderfully!</li>
