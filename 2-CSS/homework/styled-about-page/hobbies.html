    <!-- What is this hobby exactly? -->
    <p>Since learning more about tech, I love filling my day with learning Web Development technologies. However, I also love writing, reading and watching tv shows and movies. At the moment, I'm watching Sex and the City. I like watching different genres and finding a different story for every mood.</p>

    <!-- How does it make you feel? -->
    <p>Getting invested in a good story is so wonderful. Be it from a book or a film/show. It's lovely be be able to switch off completely.</p>

    <!-- Where have you traveled because of your hobby? What other life experiences has your hobby provided, that you might not otherwise experience? -->
    <p>I used to watch anime. I became invested in Japanese culture during that time. I always wanted to visit the country and see how the culture is in relation to its depiction in literature. My Japanese friend invited me over to spend time with her family as she saw I was interested in the culture. It was a wonderful experience. I felt like part of the family and got a true Japanese experience.</p>
